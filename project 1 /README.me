# 🗂️ simple_ls.py

A small and simple Python script that mimics the basic behavior of the Linux `ls` command.  
It lists all files and folders in a given directory using only built-in Python libraries.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Lists all files and directories in a given path  
- Detects and labels directories with `[DIR]`  
- Handles missing paths and permission errors gracefully  
- Works on Linux, macOS, Windows, and Termux  

---

## 🧠 How It Works
The script:
1. Accepts a directory path as a command-line argument (`sys.argv[1]`).  
2. If no argument is provided, it uses the current working directory (`os.getcwd()`).  
3. Uses `os.listdir()` to get all items inside the folder.  
4. Prints their names and indicates which ones are directories.

## 💻 Usage

### 1. Run in the current directory:
```bash
python simple_ls.py
